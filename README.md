# Dotfiles
Dotfiles are used for customizing operating systems. I store my dotfiles, scripts, and plugins in this repository to synchronize the preference and settings among various machines. Please star my repository if you find this resource helpful. If you have any questions or encounter technical problems, please create a "new issue" under this repository title. 


## Key Features
- Vim - Vim is my favorite editor, and I'm working on adding more customization functionalities into my configuration files.

- Tmux - [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) is a powerful software application to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple Linux/Unix servers remotely. I have customized a configuration file [here](./.tmux.conf).

- Zsh - I used to use Bash for all my Linux/Unix machines, and I got started to use Zsh until I found [this](http://ohmyz.sh/)
