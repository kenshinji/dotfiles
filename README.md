# Dotfiles
This is the repository for keeping all my dotfiles and make all of my dotfiles on different machines are synchronizable. If you find this repository is helpful for you, please don't hesitate to star it. And please feel free to submit issues if you have any questions.

## Key Features
- Vim - Vim is my favorite editor, and I'm working on adding more customization functionalities
into it.

- Tmux - [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) is a teminal multiplexer. It is very powerful especially when you have to work on Linux/Unix server remotely. I have a customized configuration file for it [here](./.tmux.conf).

- Zsh - I used to use Bash for all my Linux/Unix machine, and I got started to use Zsh until I found [this](http://ohmyz.sh/)
